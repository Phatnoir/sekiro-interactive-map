- Automatically saves progress between sessions using localStorage

## Usage

1. Download both files (`sekiro_map_checklist_responsive.html` and `Sekiro locations.png`) into the same folder.
2. Open the HTML file in your browser.
3. Click checkboxes to mark your progress.
4. Progress is saved automatically and will persist between visits.

## Requirements

- A modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- Both files must remain in the same directory

## Notes

- Your progress is stored locally in the browser (`localStorage`)
- Clearing site data or switching browsers will reset your checklist
